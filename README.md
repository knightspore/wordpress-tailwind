# TailwindCSS Wordpress Starter

An extension of [HTML5Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank) using TailwindCSS with Laravel Mix.

On my blog you can read about [how to create a TailwindCSS Wordpress Theme](https://ciaran.co.za/tailwind-css-wordpress-theme-tutorial/). 

## Installation

With NPM: 
```bash
npm install
npm run watch
```

With Yarn:
```bash
yarn
yarn watch
```

You can alternately run `dev` to generate readable assets, or `prod` to run a production build.

## Usage

This is a blank copy of HTML5Blank with TailwindCSS installed, nothing more. Your assets build from `./assets` to `./js/scripts.js` and `./style.css`
